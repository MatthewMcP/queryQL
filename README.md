This project is playing with the idea of a user making a single database call and generating a site from this. It is primarily a learning experience. The basic premise of this is that each graphQL call returned an key-value object (with key being field name), applying the 80-20 rule most of the display will be simple output of values and the use of the grid system allows these to be generated in a way that allows the display to look nice.

There are a few other expansions I'd like to expand onto this (for example a table system) and something cool within the URL but that will be later down the line.

There are many many improvements I'd like to make with this. The code definitely needs improved and it won't be hard to expand this to cover more use cases.
